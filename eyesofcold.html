<h1>The Eyes</h1>
<p>Everywhere you go, you are not alone. You are safe everywhere you go, but you certainly aren't alone.</p>
<a href="https://www.bitview.net/watch?v=eRwEgCHb">In the forest, you are not alone.</a>
<p>In the park, you are not alone. In your house, you are not alone. In secluded areas, you are not alone. Because there they are, surveilling you. Keeping you safe. You're in their hands.</p>
